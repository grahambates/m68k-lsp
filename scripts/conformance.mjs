/**
 * Calibration for the differential checker.
 *
 * s68k describes itself as a teaching tool and says plainly: "It wasn't made to
 * assemble or make actual programs, but merely as a learning tool, don't expect
 * 100% accuracy." That is disqualifying for an oracle, so it is not treated as
 * one. When the checker reports a disagreement it says a rule and an
 * interpreter disagree, not that the rule is wrong.
 *
 * This file establishes how far the interpreter can be trusted, by running
 * behaviour whose 68000 result is documented and checking it agrees. Cases are
 * chosen for the semantics the rules actually depend on: which instructions
 * touch X, what the word multiply and divide forms do with the halves of a
 * register, and the shift and extension edges.
 *
 * Every expectation here is from the 68000 programmer's reference, and where
 * timing-adjacent, cross-checked against sources/yacht.txt.
