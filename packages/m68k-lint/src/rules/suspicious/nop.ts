/**
 * A NOP immediately before RTE is a deliberate synchronisation delay, not
 * leftover padding. On Amiga, clearing the interrupt request has to reach the
 * chipset before the RTE, or a fast CPU returns while the level is still
 * asserted and the interrupt fires again; the NOP buys that time. Some handlers
 * use more than one, so a contiguous run counts.
 *
 * A label between the two is unusual but harmless: the NOP still falls through
 * to the RTE. An intervening instruction is not, since the delay then no longer
 * sits against the return.
 *
 * Not gated on `--platform amiga`. The idiom appears in Amiga sources that are
 * linted without a platform selected, and a NOP placed immediately before an
 * interrupt return is deliberate on any target. RTR is deliberately excluded.
