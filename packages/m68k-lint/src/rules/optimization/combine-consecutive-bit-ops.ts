/**
 * Several single-bit operations on one register are one masked operation.
 *
 * `bclr #0,d0 / bclr #4,d0` clears the same two bits as `and.w #$ffee,d0`, in
 * a quarter of the cycles: measured on 68000 a two-instruction chain goes from
 * 8 bytes and 28 cycles to 4 and 8, and the four-long chains that show up in
 * real boot code go from 16 bytes and 56 cycles to the same 4 and 8.
 *
 * BSET/BCLR/BCHG only touch Z, and set it from the bit as it was *before* the
 * change, while AND/OR/EOR set N and Z from the result and clear V and C. The
 * merged form is therefore only offered where those flags are dead, which is
 * the same condition `bit-op-low-word` applies to the single-bit case.
