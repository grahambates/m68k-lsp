/**
 * A replacement stands in for whole lines, so applying one destroys everything
 * on them that is not the instruction. A label is the case that breaks a build
 * rather than merely losing information: `start: move.l #100,d0` becoming
 * `moveq #100,d0` was a `safe` suggestion that deleted `start:` and with it
 * every branch to it.
 *
 * A label on the first line still points at the same instruction, so it is
 * carried across. One further into the run has nowhere to go once the run
 * collapses, so there is no rewrite to offer.
