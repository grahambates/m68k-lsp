/**
 * Constants gathered from every file in the project, for the very common case
 * where a file uses a name an include defines.
 *
 * Files are linted one at a time, so a symbol defined in a header is simply
 * unknown, and roughly three quarters of the rules depend on resolving
 * constants. Reconstructing the real include hierarchy would need the entry
 * point and the assembler's include paths, neither of which is in the source.
 * Indexing every file sidesteps that.
 *
 * The index is deliberately monotonic: it can turn "unknown" into "known" but
 * never "known" into "wrong". A name is answered only when the whole project
 * agrees on one value for it. Where two files disagree — a per-platform header,
 * a debug and a release configuration — the name stays unknown, exactly as it
 * was before the index existed. Guessing there would be worse than not knowing,
 * because a wrong constant makes rules fire with full confidence.
 *
 * Definitions inside macro bodies are skipped for the same reason they are
 * skipped per-file: they belong to an expansion, not to a file.
