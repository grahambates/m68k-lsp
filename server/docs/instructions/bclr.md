# BCLR - Test a bit and clear

## Operation
[Z] ← ¬(\<bit_number\> OF [destination])<br/>
\<bit_number\> OF [destination] ← 0

## Syntax
```assembly
BCLR[.(bl)] <bit_number>,<destination>
```

## Attributes
`Size` byte, longword

## Description
A bit in the destination operand is tested and the state of the specified bit is reflected in the condition of the Z-bit in the condition code. After the test, the state of the specified bit is cleared in the destination. If a data register is the destination, the bit numbering is modulo 32, allowing bit manipulation of all bits in a data register. If a memory location is the destination, a byte is read from that location, the bit operation performed using the bit number modulo 8, and the byte written back to the location. Bit zero refers to the least-significant bit. The bit number for this operation may be specified either by an immediate value or dynamically by the contents of a data register.

## Application
If the operation `BCLR #4,$1234` is carried out and the contents of memory location $1234 are 1111010₂, bit 4 is tested. It is a 1 and therefore the Z-bit of the CCR is set to 0. Bit 4 of the destination operand is cleared and the new contents of $1234 are: 11101010₂.

## Condition codes
|X|N|Z|V|C|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|-|-|*|-|-|

Z: set if the bit tested is zero, cleared otherwise.

## Destination operand addressing modes

Note that data register direct (i.e., Dn) addressing uses a longword operand, while all other modes use a byte operand.
