# MULU - Unsigned multiply

## Operation
[destination] ← [destination] * [source]

## Syntax
```assembly
MULU[.w] <source>,Dn
```

## Attributes
`Size`  word (the product is a longword)

## Description
Multiply the 16-bit destination operand by the 16-bit source
operand and store the result in the destination. Both the source and destination are 16-bit word values and the destination result is a 32-bit longword. The product is therefore a correct product and is not truncated. `MULU` performs multiplication with unsigned values.

## Application
`MULU D1,D2` multiplies the low-order words of data registers D1 and D2 and puts the 32-bit result in D2. `MULU #$1234,D3` multiplies the low-order word of D3 by the 16-bit literal $1234 and puts the 32-bit result in D3.
