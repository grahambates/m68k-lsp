## Attributes
`BMI` takes an 8-bit or a 16-bit offset (i.e., displacement).

## Description
If the negative bit is set, program execution continues at location [PC] + displacement, d. The displacement is a two's complement value. The value in the PC corresponds to the current location plus two. The range of the branch is -126 to +128 bytes with an 8-bit offset, and -32K to +32K bytes with a 16-bit offset.
