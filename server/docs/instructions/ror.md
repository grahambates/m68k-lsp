# ROR - Rotate right (without extend)

## Operation
[destination] ← [destination] rotated by \<count\>

## Syntax
```assembly
ROR[.(bwl)] [<count>,]<destination>
```

## Attributes
`Size` byte, word, longword

## Description
Rotate the bits of the operand right. The extend bit, X, is not included in the operation. A rotate operation is circular in the sense that the bit shifted out at one end is shifted into the other end. That is, no bit is lost or destroyed by a rotate operation. The bit shifted out is also copied into the C-bit of the CCR, but not into the X-bit. The shift count may be specified in one of three ways: the count may be a literal, the contents of a data register, or the value 1. An immediate count permits a shift of 1 to 8 places. If the count is in a register, the value is modulo 64, allowing a range of 0 to 63. If no count is specified, the *word* at the effective address is rotated by one place (e.g., `ROR <destination>`).

```

## Condition codes
|X|N|Z|V|C|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|-|*|*|0|*|

The X-bit is not affected and the C-bit is set to the last bit rotated out of the operand (C is set to zero if the shift count is 0).
