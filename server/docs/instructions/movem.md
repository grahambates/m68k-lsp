# MOVEM - Move multiple registers

## Operation
REPEAT<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[destination_register] ← [source]<br/>
UNTIL all registers in list moved

REPEAT<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[destination] ← [source_register]<br/>
UNTIL all registers in list moved

## Syntax
```assembly
MOVEM[.(wl)] <source>,<register_list>
MOVEM[.(wl)] <register_list>,<destination>
```

## Sample syntax
```assembly
MOVEM.L D0-D7/A0-A6,$1234
MOVEM.L (A5),D0-D2/D5-D7/A0-A3/A6
MOVEM.W (A7)+,D0-D5/D7/A0-A6
MOVEM.W D0-D5/D7/A0-A6,-(A7)
```

## Attributes
`Size`  word, longword

## Description
The group of registers specified by `<register_list>` is copied to or from consecutive memory locations. The starting location is provided by the effective address. Any combination of the 68000's sixteen address and data registers can be copied by a single `MOVEM` instruction. Note that either a word or a longword can be moved, and that a word is sign-extended to a longword when it is moved (even if the destination is a data register).

When a group of registers is transferred to or from memory (using an addressing mode other than pre-decrementing or postincrementing), the registers are transferred starting at the specified address and up through higher addresses. The order of transfer of registers is data register D0 to D7, followed by address register A0 to A7.

For example, `MOVEM.L D0-D2/D4/A5/A6,$1234` moves registers `D0,D1,D2,D4,A5,A6` to memory, starting at location $1234 (in which D0 is stored) and moving to locations $1238, $123C,... Note that the address counter is incremented by 2 or 4 after each move according to whether the operation is moving words or longwords, respectively.

If the effective address is in the pre-decrement mode (i.e., `-(An)`), only a register to memory operation is permitted. The registers are stored starting at the specified address minus two (or four for longword operands) and down through lower addresses. The order of storing is from address register A7 to address register A0, then from data register D7 to data register D0. The decremented address register is updated to contain the address of the last word stored.

If the effective address is in the post-increment mode (i.e., `(An)+`), only a memory to register transfer is permitted. The registers are loaded starting at the specified address and up through higher addresses. The order of loading is the inverse of that used by the pre-decrement mode and is D0 to D7 followed by A0 to A7. The incremented address register is updated to contain the address of the last word plus two (or four for longword operands).

Note that the `MOVEM` instruction has a side effect. An extra bus cycle occurs for memory operands, and an operand at one address higher than the last register in the list is accessed. This extra access is an 'overshoot' and has no effect as far as the programmer is concerned. However, it could cause a problem if the overshoot extended beyond the bounds of physical memory. Once again, remember that `MOVEM.W` sign-extends words when they are moved to data registers.

## Application
This instruction is invariably used to save working registers on entry to a subroutine and to restore them at the end of a subroutine.

## Example
```assembly
        BSR     Example
        .
        .
Example MOVEM.L D0-D5/A0-A3,-(SP)    ;Save registers
        .
        .
        Body of subroutine
        .
        .
        MOVEM.L (SP)+,D0-D5/A0-A3    ;Restore registers
        RTS                          ;Return
```
