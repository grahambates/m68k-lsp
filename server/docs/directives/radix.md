# RADIX - Set number base

## Syntax
```assembly
RADIX <base>
```

## Description
This directive sets the default base for number literals. radix may be one of 2, 4, 8, 10 or 16 and must be specified in decimal; expressions are not allowed.

The default is decimal (base 10). Two reasons for using this command are to enter tables in a non-decimal base and to assemble code that has been generated by a disassembler or other tool that emits non-decimal numbers without the appropriate prefix.

When using hexadecimal base (16) numbers must still start with a decimal digit. For example,

```assembly
  radix 16
  dc.b 0ff
  dc.b ff
```

Here 0ff would have the valve `255` whereas `ff` would refer to the label `ff`.
