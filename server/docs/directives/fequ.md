# FEQU - Define floating point constant

## Syntax
```assembly
<symbol> FEQU[.(sdxp)] <expression>
```

## Description
Define a new program symbol with the name `<symbol>` and assign to it the floating point value of `<expression>`.
Defining `<symbol>` twice will cause an error. The extension is for Devpac-compatibility, but will be ignored.
