# OFFSET - Define offset table

## Syntax
```assembly
OFFSET [<expression>]
```

## Description
Switches to a special offset-section.
The contents of such a section is not included in the output. Their labels may be referenced as absolute offset symbols. Can be used to define structure offsets. The optional `<expression>` gives the start offset for this section. When missing the last offset of the previous offset- section is used, or `0`. `<expression>` must evaluate as a constant!
