## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2022-05-08

### Added

- `autoExpand` option for alignment formatter. This allows automatic adjustment of component positions to allow for
  elements which exceed the available space.
- Operand spacing formatter. Add or remove space between operands as allowed in VASM with `-spaces` option.

### Changed

- Defaults for alignment now use spaces. This is more reliable as tab alignment can easily break if editor tab width
  doesn't match config.

### Fixed

- Handle string operands with spaces [@dansalvato](https://github.com/dansalvato).
