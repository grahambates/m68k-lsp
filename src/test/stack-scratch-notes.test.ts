 * `move.b dN,-(sp)` reserves a word and writes only its high byte, so reading
 * the word back brings the low byte out of whatever was in that slot. The
 * CLR.B is there to zero that, not anything from the register — which means a
 * slot already zero does not need it, and zeroing one once serves any number of
 * these shifts.
 *
 * Said rather than applied: nothing here can know what is in memory below SP,
 * and an interrupt pushes its frame exactly there, so the zero survives only
 * while nothing interrupts.
