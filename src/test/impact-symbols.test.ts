 * Suggestions keep the symbols the source wrote, which is what a person should
 * paste. 68kcounter reads the written form to pick an addressing mode, and a
 * compound displacement defeats that: `lea SCREEN_BW/2+(SCREEN_H/2*SCREEN_BW)(a3),a3`
 * measures 6 bytes and 12 cycles where `lea 1610(a3),a3` measures 4 and 8. So a
 * rule that saves cycles was reported as a regression purely because of how its
 * replacement was spelled.
 *
 * The copy handed to the counter therefore has its operand expressions
 * collapsed to the values they evaluate to.
