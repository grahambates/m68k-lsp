/**
 * A macro invocation expands into instructions the linter cannot see, and a
 * macro definition emits nothing where it is written. Both were invisible to
 * the analysis: the parser gives a macro call `mnemonic.type === "macro"`, which
 * fell through every `type === "instruction"` filter, so a call was modelled as
 * a no-op reading no registers.
 *
 * These fixtures are written with real tabs rather than through the shared
 * `fixture` helper, because a macro's name sits in column zero and its body is
 * indented; normalising the indentation would rewrite the thing under test.
