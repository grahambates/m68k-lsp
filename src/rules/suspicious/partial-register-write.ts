/**
 * Which bits of the register the routine puts a value into.
 *
 * The question this rule is really asking is not whether some single
 * instruction writes the register whole, but whether the preserved bits hold
 * something the author put there. Building a long out of several narrow writes
 * is ordinary: `move.w d3,d4` then `move.b d2,d4` defines the whole low word
 * between them, and the byte write preserving bits 8-15 is the point of it.
 * Only bits that nothing in the routine ever writes are effectively undefined,
 * and those are what is worth reporting.
 *
 * A write only counts if it does not also read. DIVU takes a 32-bit dividend
 * and writes a 32-bit result, so it both consumes the upper half and replaces
 * it; counting that as establishing the register excused the exact bug this
 * rule exists to catch, a divide after only the low word was set.
 *
 * SWAP counts for everything, though it reads what it writes. It is how the
 * upper half is addressed at all, so a routine containing one is working both
 * halves on purpose: `move.w` / `swap` / `move.w` defines all 32 bits, the
 * unknown half having been rotated down and overwritten.
