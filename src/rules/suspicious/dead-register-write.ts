 *
 *   move.w d0,d1      <- d1 is never read
 *   move.w d2,d1
 *   move.w d1,foo(a0)
 *
 * Often a typo — the first write was meant for a different register — so the
 * instruction is worth looking at even where the wasted cycles do not matter.
 *
 * The instruction must do nothing except write one register and set flags, both
 * of which have to be provably unused. A load from memory still counts, but the
 * removal is only ever offered for review: the address may be a hardware
 * register that changes state when read, and dropping the load would change
 * behaviour rather than just save time. LEA is not a load - it computes an
 * address without dereferencing it - so it keeps the plain reading.
