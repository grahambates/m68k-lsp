/**
 * Setting bit 7 of a data register is what TAS does, in one word.
 *
 *   bset #7,dn      ->  tas dn
 *   ori.b #$80,dn   ->  tas dn
 *
 * This is separate from `optimization/bset-to-tas`, which covers the memory
 * form and is off by default because TAS to memory uses a locked
 * read-modify-write cycle that some hardware cannot arbitrate. A data-register
 * operand performs no memory access at all, so it carries none of that risk.
