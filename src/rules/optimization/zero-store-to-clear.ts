/**
 * Storing a zero immediate is CLR with the immediate word deleted: two bytes
 * for a word store, four for a long one, at identical cycle and bus-cycle
 * counts on 68000 (measured with 68kcounter). N/Z/V/C come out the same, since
 * both forms leave Z set and the rest clear.
 *
 * The catch is that a 68000 CLR is a read-modify-write: it reads the location
 * before writing it. For a write-only register the read returns bus noise, so
 * the location briefly holds a wrong value between the two bus cycles. That is
 * harmless wherever nothing samples the location in between -- a blitter
 * modulo is not consulted until the blit is triggered -- and it is why this is
 * offered as a review rather than applied blind.
