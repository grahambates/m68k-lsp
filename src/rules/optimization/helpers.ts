 * the name that says what the value means, and freezes a number that was
 * supposed to track the constant when it changes. `SCREEN_BW/2+(SCREEN_H/2*SCREEN_BW)`

 * parentheses are dropped, because a displacement that opens with `(` reads
 * like an addressing mode: `(SCREEN_BW*2)(a3)` is ambiguous where
