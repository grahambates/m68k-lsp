 * What to do with one finding.

 * fine and writes a directive beside it; `disable` says the rule does not suit
 * this project at all and belongs in the config, where one entry replaces a
 * comment on every occurrence.
 *
 * An earlier pair, "acknowledge" and "ignore", tried to record how the reader
 * felt about the finding. It read as a claim about intent, but equally as
 * "I have applied this by hand", which is not a suppression at all -- a finding
 * you have actually fixed stops being reported on its own.
